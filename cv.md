## About me

Having a huge experience in Testing and worked with a bunch of different projects as QA, decided to move forward with learning
Started diving deeply into the HTML, css, js, in many different schools and courses.
Done many study-projects and still not confident in knowledge. 
Here I am to study and to create the proper portfolio and cv, and after all to get hired as a Frontend Developer.
